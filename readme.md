# GScaler Cloud
##A tool to scale your graph up/down.
Enterprises and researchers often have datasets that can be represented as graphs (e.g. social networks). The owner of such a graph may want to scale it down/up to a similar but smaller/larger version for some purposes (e.g. for application development/system scalability test and so on).

Gscaler is the tool designed for such scaling, underlying algorithms are developed by Jiangwei Zhang from National University of Singapore, School of Computing.
